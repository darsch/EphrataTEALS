        // 2. For your spell, calculate the damage range. For example, for a spell
        // that does 1d6 fire damage, the damage range is 1 to 6
        // Damage range: ______ to _______

        // 3. Use Random to calculate the damage for one casting of the spell.
        // Print out the damage dealt.

        // 4. Player's choice! Expand your program - be as creative as you'd like
        // and/or choose one of the following:
        //      a. Implement the "Advanced" feature for your chosen spell
        //      b. Add print statements to tell a story featuring your spell
        //      c. In D&D, you roll a d20 to see if your spell hits its target.
        //         If you roll a 10 or higher, your spell hits! If not, it
        //         misses and no damage is dealt.
        //      d. Cast your spell multiple times (loop)
        //      e. Incorporate user interaction
    }
